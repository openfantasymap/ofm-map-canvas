# FantasyMaps Map Canvas

OFM Map Canvas is loosely based on https://github.com/mspellecacy/map-canvas 

OFM Map Canvas provides a dialog box containing a FantasyMaps/OpenStreetMap/OpenHistoryMap view port allowing you to export the corresponding battlemap as a scene for use in play. 

Walls, lights and scenery are generated based on the vectors on OFM or OSM or OHM.

To install it on Foundry, it is here: https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ofm-map-canvas
