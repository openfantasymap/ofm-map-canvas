# FantasyMaps Map Canvas

OFM Map Canvas is based on https://github.com/mspellecacy/map-canvas 

OFM Map Canvas provides a dialog box containing a FantasyMaps view port allowing you to export the corresponding 'maps image' as a scene for use in play. 

Walls, lights and scenery are generated based on the vectors on the platform.
